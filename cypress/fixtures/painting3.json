    "description": "Marten and Oopjen are the only couple Rembrandt painted lifesize, standing and full-length. Marten was the son of a wealthy Flemish immigrant who owned a successful sugar refinery in Amsterdam. Attired in a sumptuous costume with expensive lace and enormous rosettes on his shoes, he poses self-assuredly for Rembrandt. They probably knew one another from Leiden, where Marten had studied law."
