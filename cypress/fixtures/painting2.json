  "description": "Rembrandt is 55 years old in this self-portrait, and he still looks at himself candidly. Here he assumes the guise of a personage from the Bible, the Apostle Paul. The sword protruding from his cloak and the manuscript in his hands are the apostleâ€™s customary attributes. By using his own face, Rembrandt encouraged the viewer to engage personally with the saint."
